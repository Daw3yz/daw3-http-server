# Daw3 HTTP Server

I built this project to learn more about C Programming as I have never learned low level programming before. I also want to have practical experience building simpler versions of more commonly used web servers such as Nginx and Apache. My goal by the end of this is to create my own minimalist HTTP Server.

## Requirements
Just run it on Linux
